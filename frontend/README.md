## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** React 19 with Vite as the build tool
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management:** Context API for cart management
- **Routing:** React Router v7 for navigation
- **Animations:** Framer Motion and AOS (Animate On Scroll)
- **Notifications:** React Hot Toast for user feedback

### **Backend**
- **Server:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with bcryptjs for password hashing
- **Validation:** Express Validator for input validation

## üö¶ **How It Works**

### **User Flow**

#### **Browsing Food Items**
- Users land on the Home page where food items are displayed by category.
- Items are fetched from the MongoDB database via API endpoints.
- Users can search for specific items using the search functionality.

#### **User Authentication**
- New users can sign up by providing name, email, password, and location.
- Existing users can log in with their credentials.
- Authentication tokens are stored in local storage for persistent sessions.

#### **Shopping Cart**
- Users can add items to their cart, specifying size and quantity.
- The cart state is managed using Context API across the application.
- Users can modify quantities or remove items from the cart.

#### **Checkout Process**
- Users must be logged in to complete a purchase.
- Order data is sent to the backend and stored in the database.
- Confirmation notifications are displayed to the user.

#### **Order History**
- Users can view their past orders in the MyOrders section.
- Orders are fetched from the database based on the user's email.
